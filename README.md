# React Bootcamp
This repository is served only for the purpose of lecturing and coding along the course.
[The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, Router & More)](https://www.udemy.com/modern-react-bootcamp)

When I codealong, I did change some part of the code, i.e, the variable name and some logic for my better understanding<br> 
which might contains some part that is not identical to the instrutor's code. But logically, everything work exactly the same!

For each project's commit has formatted comment as follows:
```
<lecture-number># <project-name>: <task>
```

And for each project's solution is prepended with 'Sol,':
```
<lecture-number># Sol,<project-name>: <task>
```

For every solution projects have their own brach with the namming as follow:
```
<project-name>-solution
```
